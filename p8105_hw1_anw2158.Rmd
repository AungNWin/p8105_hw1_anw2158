## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

## Problem 1

```{r}
library(moderndive)

data(early_january_weather)
```

The variables in the dataset, including names/values of important variables

```{r}
names(early_january_weather)
```

The size of the dataset

```{r}
nrow(early_january_weather)

ncol(early_january_weather)
```

The mean temperature

```{r}
mean(early_january_weather$temp)
```

A scatterplot of temp (y) vs time_hour (x)

```{r}
library(ggplot2)

ggplot(early_january_weather, aes(x = time_hour , y = temp , color = humid)) + geom_point()
```

This plot shows a positive correlation between temperature and time_hour.

```{r}
ggsave("early_january_weather.png")
```

## Problem 2

Load the tidyverse package

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

A random sample of size 10 from a standard Normal distribution

```{r}
random_sample = rnorm(10)
```

A logical vector indicating whether elements of the sample are greater than 0

```{r}
logical_vector = random_sample > 0
```

A character vector of length 10

```{r}
character_vector = c("A", "B" , "C" , "D" , "E" , "F" , "G" , "H" , "I" , "J")
```

A factor vector of length 10, with 3 different factor "levels"

```{r}
factor_vector = factor(c("High" , "Medium", "Low", "High", "Medium", "Low", "High", "Medium", "Low", "Medium"))
```

Data frame

```{r}
df = data.frame (random_sample = random_sample, 
            logical_vector = logical_vector, 
            character_vector = character_vector, 
            factor_vector = factor_vector)
```

Mean of each variable using pull function

```{r}
pull(df , random_sample ) %>% mean (na.rm = TRUE)

pull(df , logical_vector) %>% mean (na.rm = TRUE)
```

Character and factor variables cannot be used with mean directly

By converting these variables to numeric and caculate the mean

```{r}
pull(df , character_vector) %>% as.numeric() %>% mean (na.rm = TRUE)

pull(df, factor_vector) %>% as.numeric() %>% mean (na.rm = TRUE)
```

Code chunk that applies the as.numeric function to the logical, character, and factor variables

```{r}
numeric_logical = as.numeric(logical_vector)
numeric_character = as.numeric(character_vector)
numeric_factor = as.numeric(factor_vector)
```

Explanation

numeric_logical: When as.numeric is applied to logical_vector, logical values are binary (1 for TRUE and 0 for FALSE), so they are represented as such when converted to numeric. Therefore, the mean can be calculated directly because as.numeric converts TRUE to 1 and FALSE to 0, which allows for meaningful calculation.

numeric_character: When as.numeric is applied to a character_vector, it attempts to convert the character values to numeric. However, characters like "A," "B," etc., cannot be directly converted to numeric values. As a result, as.numeric will return a vector of NA values for each character element and mean would also show in an NA value.

numeric_factor: When as.numeric is applied to a factor_vector, it converts the factors to their underlying integer codes. Each factor level is assigned a numeric code, and the vector is returned as numeric values representing the codes in which the mean can be calculated. These numeric codes may not dirreclty correspond to the original factor levels.
